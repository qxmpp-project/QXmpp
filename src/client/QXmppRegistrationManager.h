///
/// \brief The QXmppRegistrationManager class manages in-band registration and
/// account management tasks like changing the password as defined in
/// \xep{0077}: In-Band Registration.
///
/// <h3 id="activation">Activating the manager</h3>
///
/// To make use of this manager, you need to instantiate it and load it into
/// the QXmppClient instance as follows:
///
/// \code
/// auto *registrationManager = new QXmppRegistrationManager;
/// client->addExtension(registrationManager);
/// \endcode
///
/// <h3>Setting up service discovery correctly for this manager</h3>
///
/// This manager automatically recognizes whether the local server supports
/// \xep{0077} (see supportedByServer()). You just need to request the service
/// discovery information from the server on connect as below:
///
/// \code
/// connect(client, &QXmppClient::connected, [=]() {
///     // The service discovery manager is added to the client by default.
///     auto *discoManager = client->findExtension<QXmppDiscoveryManager>();
///     discoManager->requestInfo(client->configuration().server());
/// });
/// \endcode
///
/// As soon as the result is retrieved, the supportedByServer() property should
/// be correct and could be used to display the user whether account management
/// tasks can be performed on this server.
///
/// However, this is not relevant if you only want to
/// <a href="#register-account">register a new account on a server</a>.
///
/// <h3>Changing the account's password</h3>
///
/// To change the password of the current account changePassword() can be used.
/// Upon that either passwordChanged() or passwordChangeFailed() is emitted.
///
/// If changing the password was successful, the new password is automatically
/// set in the QXmppClient::configuration(), so reconnecting works properly.
///
/// Example:
/// \code
/// auto *registrationManager = client->findExtension<QXmppRegistrationManager>();
/// connect(registrationManager, &QXmppRegistrationManager::passwordChanged, [=](const QString &newPassword) {
///     qDebug() << "Password changed to:" << newPassword;
/// });
/// connect(registrationManager, &QXmppRegistrationManager::passwordChangeFailed, [=](QXmppStanza::Error error) {
///     qDebug() << "Couldn't change the password:" << error.text();
/// });
///
/// registrationManager->changePassword(client->configuration().user(), "m1cr0$0ft");
/// \endcode
///
/// <h3>Unregistration with the server</h3>
///
/// If you want to delete your account on the server, you can do that using
/// deleteAccount(). When the result is received either accountDeleted() or
/// accountDeletionFailed() is emitted. In case it was successful the manager
/// automatically disconnects from the client.
///
/// \code
/// auto *registrationManager = client->findExtension<QXmppRegistrationManager>();
/// connect(registrationManager, &QXmppRegistrationManager::accountDeleted, [=]() {
///     qDebug() << "Account deleted successfull, the client is disconnecting now";
/// });
/// connect(registrationManager, &QXmppRegistrationManager::accountDeletionFailed, [=](QXmppStanza::Error error) {
///     qDebug() << "Couldn't delete account:" << error.text();
/// });
/// registrationManager->deleteAccount();
/// \endcode
///
/// <h3 id="register-account">Registering with a server</h3>
///
/// Registering with a server consists of multiple steps:
///   -# Requesting the registration form from the server
///   -# Filling out the registration form
///   -# Sending the completed form to the server
///     - On failure (e.g. because of a username conflict), the process
///       continues at step 1 again.
///   -# Connecting with the newly created account
///
/// <h4>Requesting the registration form from the server</h4>
///
/// First of all, you need to enable the registration process in the
/// registration manager, which of course needs to be <a href="#activation">
/// activated</a> in the client.
///
/// \code
/// auto *registrationManager = client->findExtension<QXmppRegistrationManager>();
/// registrationManager->setRegisterOnConnectEnabled(true);
/// \endcode
///
/// After that you can start to connect to the server you want to register
/// with. No JID is set in the QXmppConfiguration for the client and instead
/// only the server is set.
///
/// \code
/// QXmppConfiguration config;
/// config.setDomain("example.org");
///
/// client->connectToServer(config);
/// \endcode
///
/// Alternatively, you can also provide a domain-only JID and no password to
/// connectToServer():
///
/// \code
/// client->connectToServer("example.org", QString());
/// \endcode
///
/// Now as soon as (START)TLS was handled, the registration manager interrupts
/// the normal connection process. The manager checks whether the server
/// supports in-band registration and whether the server advertises this as a
/// stream feature.
///
/// If the server does not support in-band registration, the manager will abort
/// the connection at this point and emit the registrationFailed() signal with
/// a fixed QXmppStanza::Error of type QXmppStanza::Error::Cancel and with a
/// condition of QXmppStanza::Error::FeatureNotImplemented.
///
/// The manager will now request the registration form. This will either result
/// in an error (reported by registrationFailed()) or, if everything went well,
/// the registration form is reported by registrationFormReceived().
///
/// To handle everything correctly, you need to connect to both signals:
///
/// \code
/// connect(registrationManager, &QXmppRegistrationManager::registrationFormReceived, [=](const QXmppRegisterIq &iq) {
///     qDebug() << "Form received:" << iq.instructions().
///     // you now need to complete the form
/// });
/// connect(registrationManager, &QXmppRegistrationManager::registrationFailed, [=](const QXmppStanza::Error &error) {
///     qDebug() << "Requesting the registration form failed:" << error.text();
/// });
/// \endcode
///
/// <h4>Filling out the registration form</h4>
///
/// Now you need to fill out the registration form. If this requires user
/// interaction, it is recommended that you disconnect from the server at this
/// point now. This is required, because some servers will kick inactive, not
/// authorized clients after a few seconds.
///
/// If the returned IQ contains a data form, that can be displayed to a user or
/// can be filled out in another way.
///
/// If the server does not support data forms, you can check the standard
/// fields of the QXmppRegisterIq. You need to search the fields for empty
/// (non-null) strings. All fields that contain an empty string are required
/// and can be filled out. You can just set values for those fields and send
/// the form as described in the next step.
///
/// \note QXmpp currently has only implemented the most important default
/// fields in the QXmppRegisterIq. The other fields are not very widespread,
/// because data forms are usually used for such purposes.
///
/// <h4>Sending the completed form to the server</h4>
///
/// <b>Option A</b>: If filling out the form goes very quick, you can set the
/// filled out form directly using setRegistrationFormToSend() and then
/// directly trigger the form to be sent using sendCachedRegistrationForm().
///
/// \code
/// registrationManager->setRegistrationFormToSend(completedForm);
/// registrationManager->sendCachedRegistrationForm();
/// \endcode
///
/// <b>Option B</b>: If filling out the form takes longer, i.e. because user
/// interaction is required, you should disconnect now. As soon as you have
/// completed the form, you can set it using setRegistrationFormToSend(). After
/// that you can reconnect to the server and the registration manager will
/// automatically send the set form.
///
/// \code
/// client->disconnectFromServer();
/// // user fills out form ...
/// registrationManager->setRegistrationFormToSend(completedForm);
///
/// // As before, you only need to provide a domain to connectToServer()
/// client->connectToServer(...);
/// // the registration manager sends the form automatically
/// \endcode
///
/// The form is now sent to the server. As soon as the result is received,
/// either registrationSucceeded() or registrationFailed() is emitted.
///
/// In case there was a conflict or another error, you should request a new
/// form and restart the process. This is especially important, if the form can
/// only be used once as with most CAPTCHA implementations.
///
/// <h4>Connecting with the newly created account</h4>
///
/// You need to disconnect now. The user can then enter their credentials and
/// connect as usually.
///
/// It is also possible to extract username and password from the sent form,
/// but that does not work always. There might also be forms that have no clear
/// username or password fields.
