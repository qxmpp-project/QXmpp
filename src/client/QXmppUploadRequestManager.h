/// \brief The QXmppUploadRequestManager implements the core of XEP-0369: HTTP
/// File Upload.
///
/// It handles the discovery of QXmppUploadServices and can send upload
/// requests and outputs the upload slots. It doesn't do the actual upload via.
/// HTTP.
///
/// To make use of this manager, you need to instantiate it and load it into
/// the QXmppClient instance as follows:
///
/// \code
/// auto *manager = new QXmppUploadRequestManager;
/// client->addExtension(manager);
/// \endcode
///
/// Apart from that, you also need to discover HTTP File Upload service(s) by
/// requesting the Service Discovery info for each Service Discovery item of
/// the server. The QXmppUploadManager will then automatically recognize upload
/// services and add them to the list of discovered services
/// \c uploadServices().
///
/// Keep in mind that theoretically any XMPP entity could promote to be an
/// upload service and so is recognized by this manager. A potential attacker
/// could exploit this vulnerability, so the client could be uploading files to
/// the attacker (e.g. a normal user JID) instead of the own server.
///
/// As soon as at least one upload service has been discovered, you can start
/// to request upload slots by using \c requestUploadSlot(). Alternatively you
/// can provide the JID of the upload service which should be used for
/// uploading.
///
