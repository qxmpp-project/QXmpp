/// \brief The QXmppRosterManager class provides access to a connected client's
/// roster.
///
/// \note It's object should not be created using it's constructor. Instead
/// \c QXmppClient::findExtension<QXmppRosterManager>() should be used to get
/// the instantiated object of this class.
///
/// It stores all the Roster and Presence details of all the roster entries
/// (that is all the bareJids) in the client's friend's list. It provides the
/// functionality to get all the bareJids in the client's roster and Roster and
/// Presence details of the same.
///
/// After the QXmpp connected successfully to the XMPP server the signal
/// \c QXmppClient::connected() is emitted and the roster is requested from the
/// server. Once QXmpp receives the roster the signal
/// \c QXmppRosterManager::rosterReceived() is emitted and after that the
/// methods of this class can be used to get the roster entries.
///
/// \c QXmppRosterManager::isRosterReceived() can be used to find out whether
/// the roster has been received yet.
///
/// The \c itemAdded(), \c itemChanged() and \c itemRemoved() signals are
/// emitted whenever roster entries are added, changed or removed.
///
/// The \c presenceChanged() signal is emitted whenever the presence for a
/// roster item changes.
///
/// \ingroup Managers
